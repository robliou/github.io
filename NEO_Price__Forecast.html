<h1>Using R to examine the rise in the price of NEO </h1>
  <p> published on May 23, 2021 by Rob Liou </p>
<p>  
<h2>Introduction</h2>
  </p>
  <p>Since its inception, the price of NEO has fluctuated violently. Besides interest in the NEO ecosystem itself, 
  are there correlates with other assets, commodities, or indices that can help us to understand why the price has 
  risen and fallen in such an unpredictable manner? In this article, we will use R to investigate potential factors, 
  including factors that crypto analysts typically would not consider, such as commodities, stock indices, and crude oil prices. 
  </p>
  <p>In particular, the factors we will use R to analyze will include the 
  historical prices of the major crypto benchmarks such as BTC and ETH. 
  We will also look at the two most popular Chinese cryptos for correlations: 
  Binance coin and Tron. We will also use broader indicators of market sentiment 
  such as the Dow Jones International Index, traditional commodities including oil, 
  corn and lumber, and the ultimate traditional inflation hedge, gold. 
  We will begin by using linear regressions to analyze the factors in 
  isolation to see which are most effective individually, then analyze them in 
  multivariate format to see which in combination are most effective. 
  We will be sure to use the vif() function to ensure that multicollinearity 
  is accounted for, that is, that redundancy is not the culprit for the 
  high r-squared, thus negating the statistical significance of our results. 
  In conclusion, these tests will give us the combination of factors that can 
  give us the best representation explaining the rise in interest of the 
  NEO ecosystem and potentially help us to create a model to predict the future direction of NEO.
  </p>

<h2> Discussion  </h2>
  </p>

  <p>Typically, the greatest single correlate for a cryptocurrency is with the rest of the crypto market. 
  Here, we use Bitcoin and Ethereum as proxies for the rest of the market. 
  Which of the two coins is NEO more correlated to? We begin by running 
  a linear regression between NEO and BTC for the 5-year history: 
  </p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the R-squared is just 2.8%, very low! Looking at the chart, we can see a correlation of sorts,
  but not a very strong one. Perhaps NEO and Ethereum are stronger? 
  After all, NEO has often been branded the “Ethereum of China” before…    
  </p>
  <br>
  
  <img src="/J.jpg" width="60%" style = "margin-left: 150px;">
  <br>
<p>
    <b> Exhibit A: Linear regression between NEO and Bitcoin (9/2017-4/2021) </b> </p>
  <img src="/A.jpg" width="60%" style = "margin-left: 150px;">
  <p> What would the 5-year history look like with ETH? </p>




  <p>Indeed, the chart correlation looks much stronger. 
    In fact, the R-squared is much more correlated, at 36.36% for the entire history. 
    Therefore, those calling NEO the “ETH of China” may be onto something.   
  </p>
  
<p>
    <b> Exhibit B: Linear regression between NEO and ETH (9/2017-4/2021) </b> </p>
<img src="/B.jpg" width="60%" style = "margin-left: 150px;">

  
<p>Does the Chinese origin also influence how investors position NEO? 
  Does it possibly make NEO more correlated with the other Chinese cryptos, 
  such as Tron or Binance? We run the regression analyses here to see what they look like. 
  </p>
  <br>
<p>
    <b> Exhibit C: Linear regression between NEO and Binance Coin (9/2017-4/2021) </b> </p>
<img src="/C.jpg" width="60%" style = "margin-left: 150px;">

<p>With Binance Coin, the correlation is not very strong- the R-squared is only 7.4%. Still, it’s more than double that of Bitcoin.     </p>
<p>
    <b> Exhibit D: Linear regression between Tron and Bitcoin (9/2017-4/2021) </b> </p>
<img src="/D.png" width="60%" style = "margin-left: 150px;">

<p>With TRX however, the correlation is the highest we’ve seen so far, at 44.4%. 
  Therefore, out of all the cryptocurrencies tested, NEO is the most correlated to Tron! 
  So, investors in NEO are most likely to also be investors in Tron, which might say something about the investor base of NEO. 
  They would then be followed by ETH, then Binance, then Bitcoin.  
  </p>
  <p>Well, we know that NEO is aiming to be the platform for digital assets. 
  Therefore, is there any strong correlation with actual physical commodities? 
  As in, transactions in the real world? We examine commonly used proxies for physical commodities here: 
  lumber, corn, DJIA, crude oil, brent.    
  </p>
  <p> Gold is typically seen as the premier commodity used as a hedge against inflation. 
  However, in recent years, some have claimed that its price has been managed, and has not really reflected inflation.    
  </p>
  <p> For Gold:
  </p>
<p>
    <b> Exhibit E: Linear regression between NEO and Gold (9/2017-4/2021) </b> </p>
<img src="/E.png" width="60%" style = "margin-left: 150px;">
  
  <br>
  
 <p> Indeed. The correlation between gold and NEO is just 3%. </p>
   <p> For this reason, we venture into other commodities that may more accurately represent 
   the direction of markets in the past few years such as actively traded and consumed commodities, 
   beginning with lumber:
   </p>
   <p> Here is the regression for lumber:</p>
<p>
    <b> Exhibit F: Linear regression between NEO and Lumber (9/2017-4/2021) </b> </p>
     <img src="/F.png" width="60%" style = "margin-left: 150px;">
<p> The R-squared between lumber and NEO is 13.99%, which is quite high.
</p>
  <p> Corn: </p>
<p>
    <b> Exhibit G: Linear regression between NEO and Corn (9/2017-4/2021) </b> </p>
      <img src="/G.png" width="60%" style = "margin-left: 150px;">
    <p> The r-squared between corn and NEO is 4.28%.</p>

    <p> Crude oil: </p>
<p>
    <b> Exhibit H: Linear regression between NEO and Crude Oil-Brent (9/2017-4/2021) </b> </p>
        <img src="/H.png" width="60%" style = "margin-left: 150px;">
    <p> The R-squared between Crude Oil (Brent) and NEO is 10.35%, also quite high.</p>
<p>
    <b> Exhibit H: Linear regression between NEO and Crude Oil-Brent (9/2017-4/2021) </b> </p>
        <img src="/I.png" width="60%" style = "margin-left: 150px;">
    <p> DJIA: </p>
    <p> Lastly, the R-Squared between the Dow Jones Industrial Average and NEO is just .1%, 
          <img src="/J.jpg" width="60%" style = "margin-left: 150px;">
    meaning that NEO prices do not appear to track broader stock market prices in a meaningful way, 
    a somewhat surprising finding.
    </p>
    <p> Therefore, on an individual basis, the strongest correlation appears to be with lumber, 
    followed by brent oil, then corn, then lastly, the DJIA.
    </p>
      
  <p>
  <h2>Multivariate Regression Analyses    </h2> </p>
  <p> Multivariate Regression Analyses is the process of running a regression analyses using multiple variables. 
  It is similar to running a linear regression, except that it tells us which combination of variables is 
  most responsible for the outcome of a probability equation. 
  The nuance is that we have to make sure that the variables do not suffer from overlap due to inheritance from a common underlying variable- 
  this is known is multicollinearity. 
  We must test for this using the VIF() function.
  </p>
  <p>If we run a linear multivariate regression using multiple cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and TRX, 
  and throw in a few commodities such as Lumber and Corn, we can achieve an R-squared approaching 90%. 
  </p>
<p>
  <p3> Residual standard error: 11.17 on 901 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.8535, <br>	Adjusted R-squared:  0.8522 
F-statistic: 656.1 on 8 and 901 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
  </p3>
    </p>

    <p> However, our multi-collinearity will approach a threshold that is beyond acceptable. 
  </p>
    <p>
  <p3>
    data$ETH    data$BTC data$Lumber    data$BNB    data$TRX   data$DJIA  data$Brent   data$Corn <br>
    17.980369   19.008947    6.183506    4.504967    3.166828    4.191164    1.476786    5.305859
    </p3>
    <p/>
    <p> Therefore, to get below the threshold, we must throw out some over-lapping variables, 
  though it appears that any combination of commodities can be chosen, 
  since they do not appear to suffer from multicollinearity effects. 
  </p>
  <p> In this case, the optimum combination chose would be  Lumber - Tron - DJIA - Crude Oil- Corn 
  which can help us to explain 56% of the price variation in NEO. Not too bad. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <p3>
      data$Lumber    data$TRX   data$DJIA  data$Brent   data$Corn <br>
   3.699971    1.931040    2.838525    1.208790    3.270502 
    </p3>
  </p>  
<p>In other words, if we can forecast these 3 factors, then we can forecast over 50% of the price variation in NEO. 
    However, since forecasting the price variation of Tron might be difficult, what if we were able to forecast the price of commodities?
    What is the most impact we could have on the price of NEO?
</p>
<p> Other viable combinations that would not violate multicollinearity include:  
</p>
<p>
    <b> Exhibit A: Multivariate regression between NEO and various combinations (9/2017-4/2021) </b> </p>
        <img src="/K.jpg.png" width="60%" style = "margin-left: 150px;">
<p> 
  We should note a few things here- in the author’s estimation, 
  it is far easier to estimate the prices of commodities than it is to estimate the price of other crypto currencies, 
  or even the stock market. The reason is because commodities often reflect inflation expectations, 
  which are often telegraphed. See here for an article I wrote previously on how oil prices can be forecast effectively. 
  </p>
  
 
  <p> 1) Lumber - Tron - DJIA - Crude Oil- Corn (56.91%) </p>
  <p> 2) Tron- Lumber- Crude Oil- Corn (51.42%) </p>
  <p> 3) Crude Oil-Lumber-Corn-Gold (38.05%) </p>
  <p> 4) Lumber - Corn - Crude Oil (28%)</p>
  
 
  <p>
    The optimum combination would be Lumber + Crude Oil + Corn + Gold. 
    The 4 combined have an R-squared of 38%. Not great, but not bad either. 
    Since forecasting the price of commodities is much more do-able, I will post an article on that in the future. 
    In the meantime, <a href = "https://flashrob01.github.io/oilprice.html" style = "margin-left": 150px;" > here </a> is an article on forecasting the price of oil.
  </p>
  <p>
    Future articles will conduct analysis on a more time sensitive basis, 
    as well as provide analysis on how predictive methods can be used to
    forecast the prices and trends for inflationary 
    factors such as crude oil prices, lumber, and TRON.

  <p>
  <h2> Summary </h2>
  </p>

      <p> On a <b> single linear regression </b> basis, the <b> cryptos </b> with the strongest correlation to NEO are: </p>
  <p> 1) Tron (44.4%) </p>
  <p> 2) ETH (36.36%) </p>
  <p> 3) Binance (7.4%) </p>
  <p> 4) Bitcoin (7.5%) </p>
      <p> The <b> commodities </b> with the strongest correlation are: </p>
  <p> 1) Lumber (13.99%) </p>
  <p> 2) Crude oil- Brent (10.35%)</p>
  <p> 3) Corn (4.28%) </p>
  <p> 4) Gold (3%) </p>
  <p> 5) Stocks (DJIA) (.1%) </p>
      <p> From a <b> multivariable </b> perspective, the most effective way to forecast the price of NEO would be to forecast the prices of  </p>
  <p> 1) Lumber - Tron - DJIA - Crude Oil- Corn (56.91%) </p>
  <p> 2) Tron- Lumber- Crude Oil- Corn (51.42%) </p>
  <p> 3) Crude Oil-Lumber-Corn-Gold (38.05%) </p>
  <p> 4) Lumber - Corn - Crude Oil (28%)</p>
  <p> Forecasting the latter may be more feasible and may be more feasible. 
    For example, here is an example I wrote previously on forecasting the price of oil. 
    However, future articles will focus on forecasting the price of other commodities singularly and in aggregate as well. 
    In the meantime, I welcome any feedback you may have! </p>
  <p>The fact that we cannot use commodities or other cryptos to forecast the price of NEO is also a good thing- 
    it tells us NEO does have its own pricing mechanisms that determine its own direction, irrespective of broader market trends. 
    This is important as we consider that NEO is attempting to become the digital asset of choice.
